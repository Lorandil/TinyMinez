This will become a MineSweeper hommage on TinyJoypad!

Global variables use 102 bytes (19%) of dynamic memory, leaving 410 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 512 bytes.

The game display logic already works :)

+ start screen (during which the random seed can be increased)
+ *BOOM* screen
+ flashing on *BOOM*
+ display uncovered level after explosion

To do:

* change numbers font to 6x8 (8x8 doesn't look good)? Or redo digits
* increase board size to 14 * 8?
* different difficulty levels (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 bombs?)
* add scrolling for even larger fields
* add sound effects (pitch depending of number of mines in the neighbourhood?)
* try vertical shearing on explosion (like a rotation)
* always save game state to EEPROM?
* replay level function (store last seed on level start)
* replay is optional (configuration value)
