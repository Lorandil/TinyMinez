Sketch uses 7508 bytes (91%) of program storage space. Maximum is 8192 bytes.
Global variables use 254 bytes (49%) of dynamic memory, leaving 258 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 512 bytes.

The game display logic already works :)

+ start screen (during which the random seed can be increased)
+ *BOOM* screen
+ flashing on *BOOM*
+ display uncovered level after explosion
+ added different difficulty levels (5, 10, 15, 20 bombs?)
+ added difficulty selection
+ detect if the player lost or won the game
+ stack overflow -> changed uncovering from recursion to iteration(s)
+ uncover all bombs on ***BOOM***
+ added some instructions
+ added two different GAME WON screens depending on difficulty

To do:

* Fix bug on restart after ***BOOM*** when the board isn't reset
* add sound!
* remove dead code and data
* clean up
* change flags to UPPER CASE
* change numbers font to 6x8 (8x8 doesn't look good)? Or redo digits
* increase board size to 14 * 8?
* add scrolling for even larger fields?
* add sound effects (pitch depending of number of mines in the neighbourhood?)
* try vertical shearing on explosion (like a rotation)
* always save game state to EEPROM?
* replay level function (store last seed on level start)
* replay is optional (configuration value)
