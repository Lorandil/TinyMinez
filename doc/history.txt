This will become a MineSweeper hommage on TinyJoypad!

Sketch uses 1664 bytes (20%) of program storage space. Maximum is 8192 bytes.
Global variables use 102 bytes (19%) of dynamic memory, leaving 410 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 512 bytes.

The game display logic already works :)

To do:

* start screen (during which the random seed can be increased)
* *BOOM* screen
* change numbers font to 6x8 (8x8 doesn't look good)? Or redo digits
* increase board size to 14 * 8?
* different difficulty levels (10,20,30 bombs?)
